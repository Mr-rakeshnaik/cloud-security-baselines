# cloud-security-baselines

Infrastructure-as-Code security baselines for AWS and Azure aligned to
NIST 800-53, CIS Benchmarks, and cloud security best practices.

## Objectives
- Enforce least-privilege IAM by default
- Ensure centralized logging and monitoring
- Prevent common cloud misconfigurations
- Provide guardrails that reduce attack paths

## Security Domains Covered
- Identity & Access Management (IAM / CIEM)
- Logging & Monitoring
- Network Exposure
- Baseline Compliance Validation

## Technologies
- Terraform (baseline enforcement)
- Python (configuration validation)
- AWS & Azure native security controls

## Example Use Cases
- Cloud security posture management (CSPM)
- Pre-production guardrail enforcement
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Security engineering reference implementation

## Mapping to Frameworks
- NIST 800-53: AC, AU, IA, CM
- CIS AWS & Azure Foundations
